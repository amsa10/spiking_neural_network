spiking_neural_network.py defines a simple Spiking Neural Network with one hidden layer and one output layer. It uses the SpikeProp algorithm for training. You can adjust parameters such as the number of hidden neurons, learning rate, and number of epochs according to your requirements.


probabilistic_spiking_network.py spiking neural network that computes cumulative probabilities instead of using linear neurons with thresholds. We can achieve this by using probabilistic spiking neurons that accumulate probabilities over time.In this implementation,  using sigmoid activation functions for both the hidden and output layers. The network accumulates probabilities over time steps.
